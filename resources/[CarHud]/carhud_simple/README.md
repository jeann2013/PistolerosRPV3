# guille_carhud (KM/H)

## Preserve the original name to support me. THX

A simple car hud that combines with my hud. Contains RPM, gear, fuel and km/h.

To install it you must put in the server.cfg `ensure guille_carhud-km-h-`

I hope you enjoy it.

You can see other scripts made by me in the cfx forum or in my git profile.
